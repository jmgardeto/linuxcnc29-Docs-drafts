Installation (from https://github.com/mquinson/po4a/README.md):
***************************************************************

(after git clone) ""To install this module, type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build install""

This fails on my system. Perl seems to need modules that are not available in it.
""Can't locate Module/Build.pm in @INC (you may need to install the Module::Build module)""

From $> man Perl 1
******************

""If you're new to Perl, you should start by running "perldoc perlintro""
""You need to install the perl-doc package to use this program.""

perl-doc installation, via synaptic ---> OK

From $> perldoc perlintro
*************************

""Using Perl modules
    Perl modules provide a range of features to help you avoid reinventing
    the wheel, and can be downloaded from CPAN ( <http://www.cpan.org/> )
    
    To learn how to install modules you download from CPAN, read
    perldoc perlmodinstall.""

From $> perldoc perlmodinstall
******************************
    
""The CPAN is the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network and can be accessed at <http://www.cpan.org/> , and
searched at <http://search.cpan.org/>""

Now I can find and download the Module::Build module from CPAN
---> Module-Build-0.4231.tar.gz

""Also note that these instructions are designed to install the module
       in your system's Perl module repository, but you can install
       modules in any directory you want.""

We are going to install the perl modules in the system directory. In this way, the following steps are universal.

There are four steps we must follow now:

""  DECOMPRESS the file
    UNPACK the file into a directory
    BUILD the module (sometimes unnecessary)
    INSTALL the module.""

DECOMPRESS and UNPACK
    gzip -dc Module-Build-0.4231.tar.gz | tar -xof -

    I already have a directory with the source files/directories of the module:

    operador@elite:~/Descargas/perlModules/Module-Build-0.4231$ ls
    bin       Changes  inc      lib      Makefile.PL  META.json  README
    Build.PL  contrib  INSTALL  LICENSE  MANIFEST     META.yml   t

BUILD

    At this point, we have a dilemma:

    The module's INSTALL file says:
   ""Go into the newly-created directory and type:

              perl Makefile.PL
              make test""

    On the other hand, the perlmodeinstal help from the Perl documentation says:
    "" Go into the newly-created directory and type:

      perl Makefile.PL
    . . . ""

    Both roads lead us to the same place ......""ERRORS/WARNINGS FOUND IN PREREQUISITES.""

    "" ....
    Checking optional features ...
    inc_bundling_support .... disabled
      requires:
      ! inc::latest is not installed
    .... ""

   This is because Makefile.PL runs Build.PL
   
   gzip -dc inc-latest-0.500.tar.gz | tar -xof -
   
   operador@elite:~/Descargas/perlModules/inc-latest-0.500$ ls
   Changes            cpanfile  lib      Makefile.PL  META.json  perlcritic.rc  t            xt
   CONTRIBUTING.mkdn  dist.ini  LICENSE  MANIFEST     META.yml   README         tidyall.ini
   
   $ perl Makefile.PL   ---> OK
   $ make test --->
         "". . .
           All tests successful.
           . . . 
           Result: PASS""
INSTALL

   From the Perl documentation
        ""While still in that directory, type:

              make install
              . . .
              Often, you'll need to be root.""

   We now try to install inc-latest-0.500;
   
   $ sudo make install
   [sudo] password for operador: 
   Manifying 2 pod documents
   Installing /usr/local/share/perl/5.28.1/inc/latest.pm
