Releasing v0.65

Installation (from https://github.com/mquinson/po4a/README.md):
***************************************************************

(after git clone) To install this module, type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build install

This fails on my system. Perl seems to need modules that are not available in it.
""Can't locate Module/Build.pm in @INC (you may need to install the Module::Build module)""

From $> man Perl 1
***************

""If you're new to Perl, you should start by running "perldoc perlintro""
""You need to install the perl-doc package to use this program.""

perl-doc installation, via synaptic ---> OK

From $> perldoc perlintro
*************************

""Using Perl modules
    Perl modules provide a range of features to help you avoid reinventing
    the wheel, and can be downloaded from CPAN ( <http://www.cpan.org/> )
    
    To learn how to install modules you download from CPAN, read
    perldoc perlmodinstall.""

From $> perldoc perlmodinstall
******************************
    
""The CPAN is the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network and can be accessed at <http://www.cpan.org/> , and
searched at <http://search.cpan.org/>""

Now I can find and download the Module::Build module from CPAN
---> Module-Build-0.4231.tar.gz

""Also note that these instructions are designed to install the module
       in your system's Perl module repository, but you can install
       modules in any directory you want.""

We are going to install the perl modules in the system directory. In this way, the following steps are universal.

There are four steps we must follow now:

""    DECOMPRESS the file
    UNPACK the file into a directory
    BUILD the module (sometimes unnecessary)
    INSTALL the module.""

DECOMPRESS and UNPACK
    gzip -dc Module-Build-0.4231.tar.gz | tar -xof -

I already have a directory with the source files/directories of the module:

operador@elite:~/Descargas/perlModules/Module-Build-0.4231$ ls
bin       Changes  inc      lib      Makefile.PL  META.json  README
Build.PL  contrib  INSTALL  LICENSE  MANIFEST     META.yml   t
